# Brain-Age-Prediction
This project analyses publicly available sMRI data of healthy subjects to train a regression model to predict an age that is as close as possible to the chronological age of the person. As per domain knowledge, this is expected in case the individual is neurologically healthy. But in case of an Alzheimer's patient, where there is a significant degeneration of brain cells, the predicted age of the model would be significantly different from the individual's chronological age. The implementation of the workflow has been done on Python. Methods from Image Processing, Statistics and Machine Learning have been used to analyse this data.
